# Database project

### Description

Building the **database** with the help of some structures, using the work with **pointers**. The idea of the project is to log in a user present in that database through a unique password (set by it) whose practical purpose is to vote in various democratic elections.

### Implementation
Create basic functions such as `adding` a person to the database, `deleting` a person, `logging in`, `voting`, `displaying` the number of votes for each candidate.

### Concepts
I will work especially with **pointers** and the database itself will consist of a **generic vector** in which I will copy the bytes of a structure type element. Thus, the topic itself will cover the part of **dynamic allocation** and working with pointer variables.
